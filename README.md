Skin burn Image Classification and Detection


	We submitted our problem statement on the topic Skin Burn ImageClassification and Detection with our purpose being Skin Burn is a vital skin problem which is often ignored and not taken care of in its early stages, this is due to the unawareness regarding the detection of different degrees of skin burn. 
	Our project aims to propose a solution for the same. With the help of image classification our model will train images of different degrees of skin burn and will help the user identify the degree of skin burn they are suffering with. 

1)	Dataset – Our Dataset includes a Train Folder and a Test folder. Both are further divided into 3 folders namely – degree0, degree1 and degree2. 

2)	Static – This folder contains CSS and JavaScript files which were used in the deployment of the model using flask.


3)	Templates –  Html file templates used in the web deployment of the project.

4)	Uploads – In this folder, all the images which are loaded to the server for predictions are saved for future purposes. 


5)	App.py –  This is a basic flask file which connects the models implemented to the Frontend files and was used in the deployment of the project.  

6)	Basic CNN model – Implementation of Basic Cnn model 


7)	Transfer Learning techniques – Implementation of Inception net , Resnet50, Vgg16 and  Vgg19

8)	Model Prediction video
